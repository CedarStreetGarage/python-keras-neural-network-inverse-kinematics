# Neural Network Kinematics

This project seeks to train a neural network to perform inverse kinematics for rigid body link chains.  This
is by no means a new idea, and it is a discipline where there are in many cases both iterative and
closed-form solutions.  More generally, this is a study of minimizing error using neural networks 
on arbitrary nonlinear mappings.
